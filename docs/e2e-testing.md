# E2E Testing

## To Test locally with Appium and Webdriver:

1. run the debug version of the app `yarn android` or `yarn ios`
2. In a new terminal run `yarn start:appium`
3. In a new terminal run `yarn test:e2e:android` or `yarn test:e2e:ios`

## To Test with Browserstack (cloud devices):

\*\* this will eventually be integrated into CI, but for now you can test locally if you have
access to browserstack.com

```
export BROWSERSTACK_USER=YOURUSER
export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=YOURKEY
export BROWSERSTACK_APP_ID=bs://YOURAPPID
```

run `yarn test:browserstack:android`

## Getting the Name of an Android or IOS device

There is a script in `bin/get-testing-device.sh` that will automatically get the name of the android or ios device and set the env vars `TEST_DEVICE_ANDROID` and `TEST_DEVICE_IOS`

You can also manually set the environment variable for the test device like this:

Android

```
TEST_DEVICE_ANDROID="Pixel 3 API 29" yarn test:e2e:android
```

IOS

```
TEST_DEVICE_IOS="iPhone 13" yarn test:e2e:ios
```

## Authenticated Tests

To run the authenticated tests you need to set the env variable `GALOY_TOKEN`. The e2e test will navigate to the settings/build version page and input the token
