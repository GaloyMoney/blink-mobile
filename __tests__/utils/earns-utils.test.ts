Never once.\n\nThen what exactly has been hacked? \n\nCertain digital wallets that did not have proper security in place. \n\nJust like a physical wallet holds fiat currency (in the form of paper bills), digital wallets hold some amount of bitcoin. \n\nIn the physical world, criminals rob banks ‚Äî and walk away with US Dollars. The fact that someone robbed a bank does not have any relationship as to whether the US Dollar is stable or reliable money. \n\nSimilarly, some computer hackers have stolen bitcoin from insecure digital wallets ‚Äî the online equivalent of a bank robbery. \n\nHowever, it is important to know that the bitcoin network has never been hacked or compromised !",
