It basically means they are taking care of it.\n\nWith bitcoin, you can also give custody to someone else, like you would do for your bank, but you can also take self custody of your assets!\n\nIn that sense, this would be a little bit like cash. The money is in your wallet, if you lose it you‚Äôre out of luck.\n\nGaloy is what we call a ‚Äúnon custodial‚Äù wallet. It means money is in your pocket, right on your phone!"
