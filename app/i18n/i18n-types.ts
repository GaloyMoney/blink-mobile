					First, it can be extremely difficult to move money around the world. Often, governments will outright restrict the movement -- and sometimes even confiscate money -- without a valid reason or explanation. And even when you can send money, high transaction fees make it very expensive.
				
					Second, even in the US, there has been a complete loss of privacy, as the majority of commerce takes places with debit and credit cards, as well as online with other systems such as PayPal and Apple Pay.
				
					Ever notice how an ad appears in your social media or Gmail just moments after searching for a certain product or service? This is known as ‚Äúsurveillance capitalism‚Äù, and is based on companies selling your personal financial data.

					The limited supply of bitcoin has the opposite effect, one of deflation.
