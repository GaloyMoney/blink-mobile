The net effect of this incursion into Africa was the transference its vast natural resource wealth to Europeans and the conversion of aggry beads from hard money to soft money.\n\nAs societies continued to evolve, they began to move away from artifact money like stones and glass beads and towards monetary metals.\n",

In his announcement of the project, Satoshi Nakamoto gave the following explanation:\n\n\"The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.\"\n",

Proof of work is what allows this to happen. The point of proof of work is to create an irrefutable history. If two histories compete, the one with the most work embedded in it wins.\n\nThe chain with the most work is the truth, by definition. This is called Nakamoto consensus. This works because work requires energy. In Bitcoin, work is computation. Not any kind of computation, but computation that has no shortcut: guessing.\n\n  In the absence of a central authority, proof of work is necessary because it ensures that there is no shortcut to adding transactions to the blockchain.\n\n  Miners must compete to solve the puzzle through brute force computation, which is probabilistic in nature, and the proof that the work has been done becomes self-evident in the outcome of the work. This makes it very difficult for any one person or group to manipulate the transaction history.\n",

If you make the wrong choice, you might face consequences or miss out on benefits.\n\nCommunication works the same way - it's like a multiplayer cooperative game played with others in the same network. We use standardized protocols (like email, spoken language, or money) to communicate efficiently with as many people as possible, with as little friction as possible. This can lead to increased trade, knowledge exchange, and innovation.\n\nIn the digital world, people tend to choose the same option (the Schelling point) when exchanging value. This is because they expect that others will also choose it.\n\nThe option that becomes the Schelling point is the one that communicates price signals most accurately, allowing market participants to coordinate with each other.\n\nBitcoin is a protocol for exchanging value that has several advantages over traditional currencies (called \"fiat\"). For example, it has a fixed supply and its value has generally increased over time, while fiat currencies often lose value. Additionally, the bitcoin network is permissionless, global, and indestructible. All of these factors make bitcoin a natural Schelling point for money.\n",

This happens because increased efficiency often leads to lower costs, which can increase demand for the resource.\n\nOne example of this is the use of coal as an energy source. In the late 1700s, people thought that coal deposits were running out, but James Watt's steam engine made it possible to use coal more efficiently. This led to an increase in the demand for coal, even though it was being used more efficiently. The relationship between energy and money is also important to consider.\n\nSome people have proposed using energy as a measure of value for money, but this has not been successful in practice. Bitcoin, on the other hand, uses a system called proof of work, which incentivizes people to use energy efficiently in order to earn rewards.\n\nWhile some people criticize the use of energy in this way, it is important to remember that humans are constantly finding new ways to generate energy, and we should not assume that energy is a fixed or limited resource.\n",

An example of this is when companies can't pay back their loans and have to borrow more money just to stay alive. This is like being a \"zombie\" company.\n\nWhen the government is in charge of these decisions, they might make mistakes because they don't have a good way to tell what is a good investment and what is not.

                        "text": "When we make decisions about investing our money, we try to predict what might happen and how much money we could make or lose. Sometimes, the amount of money we can make or lose is not equal.\n\nFor example, if we invest in something that has a big chance of making us a lot of money, but only a small chance of losing a little bit of money, we might call this an \"asymmetric payoff.\" This means that the potential upside (how much we can make) is much bigger than the potential downside (how much we can lose).\n\nOne example of this is bitcoin. Bitcoin's potential outcomes are similar to an option, meaning it either succeeds or fails. If it experiences a catastrophic event, the risk of losing money is minimized.\n\nHowever, the potential upside is much greater, as bitcoin's total addressable market has the potential to be a primary global store of wealth.\n\nAsymmetry in payoffs, or uneven potential outcomes, only occurs when there is uneven understanding or information about an investment. If everyone fully understood bitcoin, it would already be widely used as a form of currency.\n\nCurrently, not everyone is aware of bitcoin's potential as a superior monetary option, so the potential for it to increase in value depends on the demand for it increasing without a corresponding increase in the supply.\n",

As more people start using bitcoin, it has the potential to grow and become more popular.\n\nIt is also possible for people and companies to use bitcoin as part of their financial plans, to help protect their money from losing value. While the main reason people might use bitcoin now is to protect their wealth, the payment use case has been growing fast since the inception of the Lightning Network and other use cases may emerge.\n",
