The net effect of this incursion into Africa was the transference its vast natural resource wealth to Europeans and the conversion of aggry beads from hard money to soft money.\n\nAs societies continued to evolve, they began to move away from artifact money like stones and glass beads and towards monetary metals.\n",

Once the transaction is signed, it is broadcasted to the peer-to-peer network.\n\nMining is the process of adding transactions to the bitcoin blockchain. When a transaction is broadcasted to the network, it is picked up by miners, who verify that the transaction is valid (i.e., the user has the necessary funds and the private key used to sign the transaction corresponds to the public key associated with the funds).\n\nOnce a transaction has been verified, it is added to a block of transactions, along with a mathematical puzzle. Miners compete to solve the puzzle, and the first one to solve it gets to add the block to the blockchain and claim a reward in bitcoin. The reward is currently 6.25 bitcoins, plus any transaction fees that were included in the block.\n\nIn addition to adding transactions to the blockchain, mining also serves to secure the bitcoin network.

We use standardized protocols (like email, spoken language, or money) to communicate efficiently with as many people as possible, with as little friction as possible. This can lead to increased trade, knowledge exchange, and innovation.\n\nIn the digital world, people tend to choose the same option (the Schelling point) when exchanging value. This is because they expect that others will also choose it.\n\nThe option that becomes the Schelling point is the one that communicates price signals most accurately, allowing market participants to coordinate with each other.\n\nBitcoin is a protocol for exchanging value that has several advantages over traditional currencies (called \"fiat\"). For example, it has a fixed supply and its value has generally increased over time, while fiat currencies often lose value. Additionally, the bitcoin network is permissionless, global, and indestructible. All of these factors make bitcoin a natural Schelling point for money.\n",

This happens because increased efficiency often leads to lower costs, which can increase demand for the resource.\n\nOne example of this is the use of coal as an energy source. In the late 1700s, people thought that coal deposits were running out, but James Watt's steam engine made it possible to use coal more efficiently. This led to an increase in the demand for coal, even though it was being used more efficiently. The relationship between energy and money is also important to consider.\n\nSome people have proposed using energy as a measure of value for money, but this has not been successful in practice. Bitcoin, on the other hand, uses a system called proof of work, which incentivizes people to use energy efficiently in order to earn rewards.\n\nWhile some people criticize the use of energy in this way, it is important to remember that humans are constantly finding new ways to generate energy, and we should not assume that energy is a fixed or limited resource.\n",

To understand how bitcoin compares to other stores of value, you need to look at the total amount of bitcoin that is available and its value, not just the price of one unit. Bitcoin is very small and can be divided into very small amounts, down to 8 decimal places. This means that you can buy a very small part of a bitcoin if you want.\n\nPeople sometimes think that other cryptocurrencies are cheaper than bitcoin because they cost less per unit, but this is not always true. Bitcoin is a special type of digital money because it is limited in supply and cannot be made in larger amounts.\n\nThis makes it a good way to store value because the value does not decrease over time. When you look at bitcoin in this way, you can see that it is just a small part of the total amount of non-government wealth in the world.\n",

Sometimes, the amount of money we can make or lose is not equal.\n\nFor example, if we invest in something that has a big chance of making us a lot of money, but only a small chance of losing a little bit of money, we might call this an \"asymmetric payoff.\" This means that the potential upside (how much we can make) is much bigger than the potential downside (how much we can lose).\n\nOne example of this is bitcoin. Bitcoin's potential outcomes are similar to an option, meaning it either succeeds or fails. If it experiences a catastrophic event, the risk of losing money is minimized.\n\nHowever, the potential upside is much greater, as bitcoin's total addressable market has the potential to be a primary global store of wealth.\n\nAsymmetry in payoffs, or uneven potential outcomes, only occurs when there is uneven understanding or information about an investment. If everyone fully understood bitcoin, it would already be widely used as a form of currency.\n\nCurrently, not everyone is aware of bitcoin's potential as a superior monetary option, so the potential for it to increase in value depends on the demand for it increasing without a corresponding increase in the supply.\n",
