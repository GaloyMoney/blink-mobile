Glassmaking was an expensive craft in that region, which gave the aggry beads a high stock-to-flow ratio and made them rather scarce.\n\nIn the 16th century, European explorers discovered the high value ascribed to these beads by the west Africans and began importing them in mass quantities; as European glassmaking technology made them extremely cheap to produce.\n\nSlowly but surely, the Europeans used these cheaply produced beads to acquire most of the precious resources of Africa. The net effect of this incursion into Africa was the transference its vast natural resource wealth to Europeans and the conversion of aggry beads from hard money to soft money.\n\nAs societies continued to evolve, they began to move away from artifact money like stones and glass beads and towards monetary metals.\n",

Governments often borrowed money to finance wars or other expensive projects, but the gold standard made it difficult for them to do so without first accumulating enough gold to back the new currency they wanted to issue.\n\nThe gold standard was also problematic for citizens because it did not provide any guarantee that their deposits in the bank would be safe, as the value of their money was dependent on the government's ability to maintain its gold reserves.\n",

When a transaction is broadcasted to the network, it is picked up by miners, who verify that the transaction is valid (i.e., the user has the necessary funds and the private key used to sign the transaction corresponds to the public key associated with the funds).\n\nOnce a transaction has been verified, it is added to a block of transactions, along with a mathematical puzzle. Miners compete to solve the puzzle, and the first one to solve it gets to add the block to the blockchain and claim a reward in bitcoin. The reward is currently 6.25 bitcoins, plus any transaction fees that were included in the block.\n\nIn addition to adding transactions to the blockchain, mining also serves to secure the bitcoin network. This is because solving the puzzle requires a significant amount of computational power, and adding a block to the blockchain requires other miners to verify the solution. This makes it very difficult for any one person or group to manipulate the blockchain.\n",

Proof of work is what allows this to happen. The point of proof of work is to create an irrefutable history. If two histories compete, the one with the most work embedded in it wins.\n\nThe chain with the most work is the truth, by definition. This is called Nakamoto consensus. This works because work requires energy. In Bitcoin, work is computation. Not any kind of computation, but computation that has no shortcut: guessing.\n\n  In the absence of a central authority, proof of work is necessary because it ensures that there is no shortcut to adding transactions to the blockchain.\n\n  Miners must compete to solve the puzzle through brute force computation, which is probabilistic in nature, and the proof that the work has been done becomes self-evident in the outcome of the work. This makes it very difficult for any one person or group to manipulate the transaction history.\n",

In the opposite case, when miners leave the network, it takes longer to add a new block. The Difficulty Adjustment algorithm adjusts the difficulty of the mathematical puzzle to match changes in the combined computing power of all miners. This prevents the creation of more (or less) bitcoin units than the predetermined supply schedule.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to physical mining of precious metals like gold where adding more gold miners leads to a higher supply of gold and therefore a decrease in its price.

The result is that people lose trust in the debased currency and prefer to hold onto the more valuable one instead.\n\nThis principle can also apply to \"fiat\" currency, which is not backed by a physical commodity like gold or silver, if the supply of the currency is increased in a way that makes it worth less.\n\nIn recent years, the emergence of bitcoin as a digital currency has led to a trend of people saving in bitcoin and spending their traditional currency, or \"fiat,\" more quickly. This is because bitcoin is seen as having a higher long-term value and being more stable than fiat currencies.\n",

If you make the wrong choice, you might face consequences or miss out on benefits.\n\nCommunication works the same way - it's like a multiplayer cooperative game played with others in the same network. We use standardized protocols (like email, spoken language, or money) to communicate efficiently with as many people as possible, with as little friction as possible. This can lead to increased trade, knowledge exchange, and innovation.\n\nIn the digital world, people tend to choose the same option (the Schelling point) when exchanging value. This is because they expect that others will also choose it.\n\nThe option that becomes the Schelling point is the one that communicates price signals most accurately, allowing market participants to coordinate with each other.\n\nBitcoin is a protocol for exchanging value that has several advantages over traditional currencies (called \"fiat\"). For example, it has a fixed supply and its value has generally increased over time, while fiat currencies often lose value. Additionally, the bitcoin network is permissionless, global, and indestructible. All of these factors make bitcoin a natural Schelling point for money.\n",

This happens because increased efficiency often leads to lower costs, which can increase demand for the resource.\n\nOne example of this is the use of coal as an energy source. In the late 1700s, people thought that coal deposits were running out, but James Watt's steam engine made it possible to use coal more efficiently. This led to an increase in the demand for coal, even though it was being used more efficiently. The relationship between energy and money is also important to consider.\n\nSome people have proposed using energy as a measure of value for money, but this has not been successful in practice. Bitcoin, on the other hand, uses a system called proof of work, which incentivizes people to use energy efficiently in order to earn rewards.\n\nWhile some people criticize the use of energy in this way, it is important to remember that humans are constantly finding new ways to generate energy, and we should not assume that energy is a fixed or limited resource.\n",

To understand how bitcoin compares to other stores of value, you need to look at the total amount of bitcoin that is available and its value, not just the price of one unit. Bitcoin is very small and can be divided into very small amounts, down to 8 decimal places. This means that you can buy a very small part of a bitcoin if you want.\n\nPeople sometimes think that other cryptocurrencies are cheaper than bitcoin because they cost less per unit, but this is not always true. Bitcoin is a special type of digital money because it is limited in supply and cannot be made in larger amounts.\n\nThis makes it a good way to store value because the value does not decrease over time. When you look at bitcoin in this way, you can see that it is just a small part of the total amount of non-government wealth in the world.\n",

Sometimes, the amount of money we can make or lose is not equal.\n\nFor example, if we invest in something that has a big chance of making us a lot of money, but only a small chance of losing a little bit of money, we might call this an \"asymmetric payoff.\" This means that the potential upside (how much we can make) is much bigger than the potential downside (how much we can lose).\n\nOne example of this is bitcoin. Bitcoin's potential outcomes are similar to an option, meaning it either succeeds or fails. If it experiences a catastrophic event, the risk of losing money is minimized.\n\nHowever, the potential upside is much greater, as bitcoin's total addressable market has the potential to be a primary global store of wealth.\n\nAsymmetry in payoffs, or uneven potential outcomes, only occurs when there is uneven understanding or information about an investment. If everyone fully understood bitcoin, it would already be widely used as a form of currency.\n\nCurrently, not everyone is aware of bitcoin's potential as a superior monetary option, so the potential for it to increase in value depends on the demand for it increasing without a corresponding increase in the supply.\n",
