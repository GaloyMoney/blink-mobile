Never once.\n\nThen what exactly has been hacked? \n\nCertain digital wallets that did not have proper security in place. \n\nJust like a physical wallet holds fiat currency (in the form of paper bills), digital wallets hold some amount of bitcoin. \n\nIn the physical world, criminals rob banks — and walk away with US Dollars. The fact that someone robbed a bank does not have any relationship as to whether the US Dollar is stable or reliable money. \n\nSimilarly, some computer hackers have stolen bitcoin from insecure digital wallets — the online equivalent of a bank robbery. \n\nHowever, it is important to know that the bitcoin network has never been hacked or compromised !",
