This can lead to increased trade, knowledge exchange, and innovation.\n\nIn the digital world, people tend to choose the same option (the Schelling point) when exchanging value. This is because they expect that others will also choose it.\n\nThe option that becomes the Schelling point is the one that communicates price signals most accurately, allowing market participants to coordinate with each other.\n\nBitcoin is a protocol for exchanging value that has several advantages over traditional currencies (called \"fiat\"). For example, it has a fixed supply and its value has generally increased over time, while fiat currencies often lose value. Additionally, the bitcoin network is permissionless, global, and indestructible. All of these factors make bitcoin a natural Schelling point for money.\n",

This happens because increased efficiency often leads to lower costs, which can increase demand for the resource.\n\nOne example of this is the use of coal as an energy source. In the late 1700s, people thought that coal deposits were running out, but James Watt's steam engine made it possible to use coal more efficiently. This led to an increase in the demand for coal, even though it was being used more efficiently. The relationship between energy and money is also important to consider.\n\nSome people have proposed using energy as a measure of value for money, but this has not been successful in practice. Bitcoin, on the other hand, uses a system called proof of work, which incentivizes people to use energy efficiently in order to earn rewards.\n\nWhile some people criticize the use of energy in this way, it is important to remember that humans are constantly finding new ways to generate energy, and we should not assume that energy is a fixed or limited resource.\n",

Power laws can show up in different areas, like language, biology, and space. Small changes in one thing can often lead to bigger changes in the other thing.\n\nIn economics, power laws are often shown in graphs. One example of a power law is the Pareto principle, which says that about 80% of the results come from 20% of the things that cause them. In a market, this might mean that 20% of the producers make up 80% of the market.\n\nPower laws can also be seen in other parts of bitcoin, like how much power mining pools have or how many hardware wallets different companies sell. They can also be seen in how bitcoin is distributed among different addresses.\n",

Bitcoin is very small and can be divided into very small amounts, down to 8 decimal places. This means that you can buy a very small part of a bitcoin if you want.\n\nPeople sometimes think that other cryptocurrencies are cheaper than bitcoin because they cost less per unit, but this is not always true. Bitcoin is a special type of digital money because it is limited in supply and cannot be made in larger amounts.\n\nThis makes it a good way to store value because the value does not decrease over time.

Sometimes, the amount of money we can make or lose is not equal.\n\nFor example, if we invest in something that has a big chance of making us a lot of money, but only a small chance of losing a little bit of money, we might call this an \"asymmetric payoff.\" This means that the potential upside (how much we can make) is much bigger than the potential downside (how much we can lose).\n\nOne example of this is bitcoin. Bitcoin's potential outcomes are similar to an option, meaning it either succeeds or fails. If it experiences a catastrophic event, the risk of losing money is minimized.\n\nHowever, the potential upside is much greater, as bitcoin's total addressable market has the potential to be a primary global store of wealth.\n\nAsymmetry in payoffs, or uneven potential outcomes, only occurs when there is uneven understanding or information about an investment. If everyone fully understood bitcoin, it would already be widely used as a form of currency.\n\nCurrently, not everyone is aware of bitcoin's potential as a superior monetary option, so the potential for it to increase in value depends on the demand for it increasing without a corresponding increase in the supply.\n",
